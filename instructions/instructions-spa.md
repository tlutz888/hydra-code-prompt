# Introduction

This repository contains a simple Node/Express web service intended as a sandbox against which to develop code for interview and evaluation purposes. Your task, broadly speaking, is to provide a SPA ([single page application](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA)) (any framework is fine) that accepts user registration and provides some other workflows around users.

The web service also provides other endpoints, but for this task you're not required to make use of those.

This is less of a "design" challenge and more of an "engineering" challenge--we're interested to see how you approach the task and organize your code. Use of third party libraries is OK--but you will be asked to justify your choices. The UX can be spartan and functional rather than beautiful--but it should be functional!

## Requirements

Your response should include:

* A SPA that allows users to at least:
  * register for an account
  * sign in and sign out
  * see different content on the homepage depending on whether they are logged in or out.
* Any other information work you'd like to share detailing your thought process

This prompt is intentionally open-ended with incomplete requirements. Approach the problem creatively, identify important design points, and document assumptions that you have made. There are no wrong answers. Focus your response on areas that demonstrate your strengths. Our team will review your response and use it as the basis for your technical interview. Come prepared to describe your thought process and justify your decisions.

Thanks, and we look forward to speaking with you in the future!

## Service Details

You can find full details about the REST endpoints the web service offers in the `service-details.md` file. You will only need to use some of the endpoints described there to complete this task.
